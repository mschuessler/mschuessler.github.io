Hi, I am Martin - a PhD student at TU Berlin in the field of **[Human Computer Interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human–computer_interaction.)**.
As a member of the [Weizenbaum Institute’s](https://vernetzung-und-gesellschaft.de/english/) interdisciplinary research group "Criticality of AI",
I focus on **[Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_Artificial_Intelligence)**.
In particular I am trying to find a XAI framework that helps creators of AI system to support the development of appropriate trust of users in their systems.

My previous research was focused around [*spatial input for peephole displays*](/../SpatialTrackingForHandhelds).
During my master’s in computer science I was working for the Mobile and Physical Interaction Group led by [Prof. Jörg Müller](http://joergmueller.info), who also supervised my [master thesis](/pub/MasterThesis.pdf).
I was also part of the [Design Thinking Research Program](https://hpi.de/dtrp/programm/uebersicht.html) upon finishing the Basic Track of [HPI D-School](https://hpi.de/en/school-of-design-thinking/hpi-d-school.html).
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in [Business Informatics](https://farafin.de/studieninteressenten/bachelor/wirtschaftsinformatik) of Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg where I wrote my bachelor [thesis](/pub/BachelorThesis.pdf) under the supervision of [Martin Spindler](https://isgwww.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/isg/spindler.html) and [Prof. Raimund Dachselt](http://mt.inf.tu-dresden.de/~dachselt/).
