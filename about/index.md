Hi, I`m Martin, a computer scientist in the field of [Human Computer Interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human–computer_interaction.).
I obtained a Masters degree from TU Berlin in December 2016 and i am **currently looking for new challenges**.
During my studies i was working for the [Mobile and Physical Interaction Group](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/forschung/gruppen/mobile_physical_interaction/) led by [Prof. Jörg Müller](http://joergmueller.info), who also supervised my [master thesis](/pub/MasterThesis.pdf).
Recently, i was  working in the [Design Thinking Research Program](https://hpi.de/dtrp/programm/uebersicht.html) upon finishing the Basic Track of [HPI D-School](https://hpi.de/en/school-of-design-thinking/hpi-d-school.html).
I also hold a Bachelors degree in [Business Informatics](https://farafin.de/studieninteressenten/bachelor/wirtschaftsinformatik) of Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, where I wrote my [thesis](/pub/BachelorThesis.pdf) under the supervision of [Martin Spindler](https://isgwww.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/isg/spindler.html) and [Prof. Raimund Dachselt](http://mt.inf.tu-dresden.de/~dachselt/).

For my professional experience see my [**CV**](/images/CV_web.pdf) or have a look at my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schuesslerm) (a preview should be shown below).
