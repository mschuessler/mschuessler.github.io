# Useful links for novice HCI researchers
I am currently going through the proceedings of various HCI conferences in order to define the topic of my master thesis. Call it procrastination, but in the process I came across some very useful links, I would like to share with you.

# Conferences
Ok we all know CHI is considered top edge, but if you ever wondered which HCI conference is "better" than another, here is an interesting metric for you.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Top HCI publications according to Google&#39;s 2014 Scholar metrics <a href="http://t.co/1VcspEIjBI">http://t.co/1VcspEIjBI</a></p>&mdash; Jakub Dostal (@jakubdostal) <a href="https://twitter.com/jakubdostal/status/484806076253372416">July 3, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


# Visualization of Emerging HCI Topics
In case you wanted to know where current HCI research is heading, you might want to take a look at this [visual map of popular and unpopular topics at CHI in the last years](http://www.researchperspectives.org/CHI_Topics/#TrendMap)

# The who-is-who game
The HCI giants on who's shoulder you might stand on one day can be found [here](http://www.hcibib.org/authors.html). I also like to go through the affiliations of all [CHI](http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE151) publications to get an idea which Labs are currently growing strong. 


Update: Robert just told me that there is a [CHI ranking for German HCI Labs](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/chi-ranking)
